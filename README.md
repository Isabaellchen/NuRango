The Nuxt example page with an ArangoDB backend. The idea is to have just the ArangoDB for the backend with no additional middleware in between. This job is done by ArangoDB's Foxx services. It is also the place to define the api to be used with your (Vuex) state store in the frontend. If only you had push capability by arango, that would be neet, so you could push updates. I simply put this out in the open, since this project laid dormant on my computer since November 2018...

Just edit the gruntfile and use the grunt tasks for building and deployment
