The Nuxt example page with an ArangoDB backend. The idea is to have just the ArangoDB for the backend with no additional middleware in between. This job is done by ArangoDB's Foxx services. It is also the place to define the api to be used with your (Vuex) state store in the frontend. If only you had push capability by arango, that would be neet, so you could push updates. I simply put this out in the open, since this project laid dormant on my computer since November 2018...

Nginx needs to be installed in order to spawn a little webserver. It is required for accessing the site and have the paths correctly resolved by the vue router. Just edit the arango access config in the gruntfile and use its grunt tasks for building, deployment and booting nginx.
